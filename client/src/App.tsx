          <p>Stockholm, November 2020. After decades of deregulation, Swedish infrastructure has been changed
              from the roots, the land, the plot, the real estate, the property â€“ ownership.
              Privatization through tenure conversion and gentrification has amplified class tensions in the urban
              landscape as city dwellers face rising rents and displacement. The transformation of public property
              to private is a motor for the financialization of the city. Property ownership is fundamental for how
              our lives are organized. But this fundamental condition is often hidden or obscured from our view.
              And when the owner is made visible, it is normally on their terms. Knowledge about finance and
              ownership is reserved for a narrow layer of society; difficult to access and hard to grasp.
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grasp.
              Our collective work responds to this state of disorientation.
              The project Mapping the Unjust City aims to explore how mapping and infographics can
              visualise ownership and financial relations. More specifically local centres in the
              context of Stockholm.
              The presentation of data and supplementary narratives are reminders of the stark reality we
              unconsciously navigate through.
              The map presented here is a map under construction unfolding throughout the online exhibition.
